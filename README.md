# PokerMessenger

## Intro
This app allows poker being played on messenger threads (groups).
It uses [fbchat](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat) for io and
[pokerlib](https://github.com/kuco23/pokerlib) for basic poker methods.

For further reading on how to use the app, check [this site](https://kuco23.github.io/pokermessenger/documentation.html).

## Tests
Test is included and is started from the os terminal 
as in `python pokermessenger_test.py <int: player_num> <str: simulation_type>`.
`simulation_type` can be either `inputgame` or `callround`.
You can always check `python pokermessenger_test.py -h` for additional info.
